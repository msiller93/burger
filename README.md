Burger Muncher!

Burger Muncher! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat.

Whenever a user enters a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page, waiting to be devoured.

Each burger on the menu has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
